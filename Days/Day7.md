<h2> Day 7 : Read about authentication vulnerabilities </h2>

</br>

#### 1. What is authentication ?
```
-> Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device. It is a key part security for systems, 
   networks, and websites. 

-> In other words, it involves making sure that they really are who they claim to be.
```

#### 2. Three main categories of authentication factors
```
-> Something you know: This could be a password, a PIN, or a secret answer to a security question.

-> Something you have: This could be a physical token like a security key, a mobile phone.

-> Something you are: This is a biometric factor, such as a fingerprint, facial recognition, or a retina scan.
```

#### 3. How do authentication vulnerabilities arise ?
```
-> Lack sufficient defences against brute-force attacks.

-> Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation
```

#### 4. Vulnerabilities in authentication mechanism
```
-> Weak account/password recovery process
-> Vulnerable authentication logic
-> Insecure session handling
-> Missing rate limiters and lockout process
-> Insecure two-factor authentication
```

#### 5. What is the impact ?
```
-> Access to all the data and functionality that the compromised account has. 

-> If they are high-privileged account, they could take full control over the entire application and potentially gain access 
   to internal infrastructure.
```
