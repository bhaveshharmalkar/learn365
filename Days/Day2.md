#### 1. Manually navigate interesting directories 
```
When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to manually check for some directories before starting to brute force using a 
tool. For example, you can manually check for /admin/, /.config/ ....
```

#### 2. Directory brute-forcing
```
Brute-force the directories for find and identify the possible hidden directories on the web server 
Tools I can prefer ffuf, gobuster, w to fuzz
```

#### 3. Hostname to IP address 
```
When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to replace the hostname with the IP address to see anything changes.
