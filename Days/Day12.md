<h2>Day 12: Read about Access Control Vulnerabilities </h2>

</br>

#### 1. What is Access Control ?
```
-> Access control determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.

-> It involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.
```

#### 2. Three categories of it.
```
-> i) Vertical access controls:- It is a mechanisms that restrict access to sensitive functionality that is not available to other 
      types of users.

-> For ex: Admin and the other normal users.

-> ii) Horizontal access controls:- It is a mechanisms that restrict access to resources to the users who are specifically allowed 
       to access those resources.

-> For ex:- Same levels of users

-> iii) Context-dependent access controls:- Context-dependent access controls prevent a user performing actions in the wrong order.

-> For ex: library system where the librarians have access to books and other resources but not for their maintenance and inventory
```

#### 3. Common Access Control Vulnerabilities
```
-> Unprotected Sensitive Functionality
-> Parameter-based attacks
-> Poor implementation of role-based access controls
-> Insecure direct object references
-> Multi-step attacks
-> Attacks on referer-based mechanisms
```

#### 4. Impacts of Broken Access Control
```
-> Exposure to Unauthorized Content
-> Attackers can gain access to critical systems
-> Compliance violations
```
