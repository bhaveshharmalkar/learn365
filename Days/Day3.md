#### 1. Check the SSL certificate
```
It often pays off to check the content of the certificate used. It's common for TLS servers to have certificates that are 
valid for more than one name or alternative names.
```

#### 2. Check response of the reuqest
```
When accessing a web server, it often pays off to check the responses' headers. It's common to find information around version 
and technologies used.
```

#### 3. Performing visual recon
```
If you have hundreds of sub-domains, then it's very convenient to use visual recon tools rather than visit each sub-domain.
Tools I prefer: EyeWitness, Aquatone, gowitness
```

#### 4. Subdomain brute-forcing
```
Find valid domain names by brute-forcing the subdomain to expand your search area.
Tools I prefer: ffuf, assetfinder, subfinder
```
