</br>

### 1. Authentication Labs
#### [<ul><li>Broken brute-force protection, multiple credentials per request</ul></li>](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-broken-brute-force-protection-multiple-credentials-per-request)
```
> In this lab, a simple login form with a username and password field After entering the lab username and incorrect password and 
  capturing the request, we see that the application sends string type of values to authenticate users.
  
> We can simply add all the passwords from the given list and put them in array format.
```

#### [<ul><li>2FA simple bypass</ul></li>](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-simple-bypass)
```
> In this lab application has secure with 2FA but in buggy format. When the user logs in with a valid username and password, the 
  application will ask for 2FA code that can be accessed from the "Email Client" and after successfully entering the 2FA code, 
  they are redirected to the "/my-account" page.

> When we try to login with other credentials that are provided in the lab, With /login2 to /my-account, we can easily manipulate 
  requests.Â 
```
