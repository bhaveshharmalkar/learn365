# Test Plan

Is a **document** that outlines the **steps taken to perform an attack**. It includes the goals and objectives of the pen test, any assumptions made about the target environment, details about the methodology employed and how it will be executed, deliverable, methods for measuring success, potential risks associated with performing a pen test and mitigation to address them and other pertinent information.

# Target Audience

Target audience is the organization that is going to be tested. Ask your client who the report and plan should be sent to, don't just send it.

# Document Goal

The document goal is to define the **scope**, **objectives**, and **processes** required to conduct a successful penetration test. This includes information on the specific tests that will be conducted as well as the technical infrastructure needed to perform them. The plan should also provide an **explanation** of risk assessment criteria and any other associated costs. **You always have to give a description of the purpose of this document.**

# Project Description

This is a functional description of the **project itself**, **not** of the pentest. Your pentesting description will come later but for now, we have to give a short overview of the functionality of our application under test.

# Methodology

In here you can give the client an overview of your tactics and your ways of attacking. for example: **Recon >> Scanning >> Gaining access >> Maintaining access >> Covering tracks.** 

# Scopes of the tests

In here, try to describe as completely as possible what can (in scope) and can not be tested.

# List of deliverables

- List all the deliverables that go alone with the project together with a date when they should be delivered:
    - Test Plan
    - NDA
    - Notice of Testing
    - Report
    - Project debriefing
