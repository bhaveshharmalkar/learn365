# Pentesting Methodology

- What is it
    - Some Testers have better quality standards than others and some will have totally different ways of testing. To make this more uniform and deliver a better end product for our customers, we can rely on a standardized methodology.
- Use of Methodology
    - ofc, everyone can hack but the complete process (including documentation) can get quite complex. Methodology is a key component of ethical hacking, as it provides structure to testing and ensures a thorough assessment. When conducting an ethical hack, the methodology chosen should allow for a disciplined approach that produces consistent results over time.

## **Which Methodologies Exist?**

### OSSTMM - Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual

- It is an **open source document**, produced under the Open Source Initiative, that provides detailed guidance for conducting various types of security tests, including **vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, source code review, architecture security assessment, policy compliance assessment and risk assessment**. and to test the operational security of **physical** locations, human interactions, and all. this type of pentest is useless when it comes to a web application.

### OWASP WSTG, MSTG

- The **WSTG** or **web security testing guide** is one of them and it is a **complete** methodology that talks about **documentation**, **execution**, and **reporting**. The **Mobile Security Testing Guide** (**MSTG**) is its cousin that focuses on testing mobile applications and their API calls.

### NIST - National Institute of Standards and Technology

- This is a methodology that revolves all around standards and you may find that it digs deep into organizational level pen-testing. They focus heavily on covering a broad scope and include everything from physical to network to application pen-testing.

### PTES - Penetration Testing Execution Standard

- It have **7** main sections, These cover everything related to a penetration test. It includes phases such as **reconnaissance**, **scanning**, **enumeration** and **exploitation**. The methodology also includes **reporting** on the findings from the tests.

### ISSAF - Information System Security Assessment Framework

- Security assessment framework created by the Information Assurance Technical Framework Working Group (IATFWG). The purpose of the ISSAF is to provide a standardized approach to conducting system security evaluation and assessment. By providing a unified set of principles, procedures and guidelines, it can be utilized as a basis for security assessments in any enterprise environment. ISSAF should primarily be used to fulfill an organizationâ€™s security assessment requirements and may additionally be used as a reference for meeting other information security needs.
